Sticky Weapons is an ESO addon created by Noromdrol.

As I was running around Tamriel as my sorcerer, I began to become annoyed that my staff would get
put away every time I read a book, or absorbed a skyshard, or fiddled with a switch, or jumped on 
my horse, or... really, just about anything. So, I wrote a little addon which will keep my weapon
drawn, no matter what. But, then it began to bug me that, when in town, my weapon was always out,
which seemed at odds with the surroundings. I'm no role player, but it seemed really weird. So,
I added the ability to swap between keeping your weapon sheathed and unsheathed. Then, added a
hotkey so that it mimics the normal sheathe/unsheathe hotkey and BOOM! Here it is for your enjoyment.

TL;DR: 
This addon will prevent your weapons from getting sheathed or unsheathed, whichever you prefer.
Also provides a hotkey to switch the two modes.
